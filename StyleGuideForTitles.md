# 1. Capitalisation

The long names should be capitalised as titles, following "standard" practise.
1. The first word is capitalised (i.e. the first letter is capital, the rest lower case);
2. Every subsequent word is also capitalised, apart from exceptions listed in (3) and in section 2;
3. The following words stay in lower case, except at the start of the title:
    - Articles: a, an, the
    - Coordinating Conjunctions: and, but, or, for, nor, etc.
    - Prepositions (fewer than five letters): on, at, to, from, by, etc.
    
See [this](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/14/which-words-in-a-title-should-be-capitalized ) for more discussion. Note that some words, such as "as", "that" can take different roles depending on the structure of the sentence so it is not possible to automate everything easily. But, in the context of CMIP variables, there is a limited range of usages.

In CMIP6, the following words are kept in lower case:
1. a
2. as at by in nm of on or to
3. and any but for non nor not out per the
4. into onto over than with

("nm" represents the units "micro-metres").

# 2. Special words

Abbreviations and technical terms may have their own capitalisation rules. The following keep the case as shown in titles:
1. X Y T D
2. 1H 1m 2H 2m 3D C3 C4 CO H2 N2 NO O2 O3 OD OH Ox XY pH
3. 10m 13C 14C CH4 CO2 CWD DMS HCl HO2 N2O NH3 NH4 NHx NO2 NO3 NOx NOy NPP O1d PAN PBL PO2 SF6 SO2 SO4 TEM TOA hPa
4. 100m 300m 700m C2H2 C2H6 C3H6 C3H8 CFAD MISR PCO2 PM10
5. 10hPa 13CO2 14CO2 2000m 4XCO2 550nm CFC11 CFC12 ISCCP MODIS NMVOC PM1.0 PM2.5 UGRID
6. CFC113 HCFC22
7. CALIPSO PARASOL 2D-field
8. 13Carbon 14Carbon

# 3. Hyphens

The hyphenation of some terms in the long names and descriptions is a little random. The general rule is that hyphenation is probably unnecessary if the phrase is used as a noun, but probably necessary if used as an adjective, e.g "Sea-ice Temperature". We should avoid excessive hyphenation of terms, but use it consistently.

The following terms are always used as adjectives, and so consistently hyphenated:
"clear-sky", "land-use", "land-cover", "all-sky", "above-ground", "below-ground"

Others may be used either with or without:
"sea-surface", "cloud-top", "Grid-cell" 

Some terms are intrinsically hyphenated:
'2D-field', 'Aerosol-Free', 'Aqueous-phase', 'Eliassen-Palm', 'Gas-phase', 'Half-Levels', 'Layer-integrated', 'Near-surface', 'Non-orographic', 'Non-woody', 'Oxygen-17', 'Oxygen-18', 'Re-freezing', 'Run-off',  'Snow-to-Ice', 'Vegetation-Covered', 'X-component', 'Y-component', , 'non-living', 'non-renewable'

Denoting interfaces (alternative usages probably preferred):
'air-sea', 'ice-ocean', 'snow-ice'

Variable usage
"sea-ice", "land-ice"(?), "sea-surface"

# 4. Issues

- NO: Nitrous oxide, but could perhaps be a negative ... need to check context;
- as, that: potential for different capitalization in some grammatical constructions;

There should be no full-stop.
